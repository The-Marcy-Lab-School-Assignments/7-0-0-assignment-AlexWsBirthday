# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function is invoked, it returns the value you gave it with an updated state. Like in App.jsx, invoking the setSize inside sizeMinus with the instructions (take a value of 10 off the value of size) returns a smaller size value, which then affects the size of the header.
