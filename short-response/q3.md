# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function is invoked, it returns the value you gave it with an updated state. Like in App.jsx, invoking the setSize inside sizeMinus with the instructions (take a value of 10 off the value of size) returns a smaller size value, which then affects the size of the header.

To elevate your answer, clarify that the setter function triggers a re-render of the component with the new state value, and specify that it does not return the updated value directly but instead schedules a state update. Also, mentioning how this change affects the component visually, like updating the size of the header, strengthens your explanation. Keep up the great work!
