# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a JavaScript framework that focuses on building components for the front-end side of web applications. Since it's a framework, it allows you to build websites seemlessly by providing pre-built tools in JS, so you only have to worry about customizing the appearance and functionality according to your target product.

Love this answer! The one small thing I would just say is that technically its a library and not a framework. People use both when describing it but we need to make sure that we understand the difference between the two. In a framework, the framework invokes the developer's code, while in a library, it's the developer who invokes the library's code. This [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-react-a-library-or-a-framework/) does a good job explaining it.
