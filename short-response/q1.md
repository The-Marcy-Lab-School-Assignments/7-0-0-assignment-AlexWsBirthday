# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a JavaScript framework that focuses on building components for the front-end side of web applications. Since it's a framework, it allows you to build websites seemlessly by providing pre-built tools in JS, so you only have to worry about customizing the appearance and functionality according to your target product.
